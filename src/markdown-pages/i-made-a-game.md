### It's a silly little thing

Lately I've felt weird about my career. I love my job, but it's made me miss the whimsicle web. I work on a handful of data-driven web sites while punching the clock.

But it doesn't really let me feel creative. On one side of the homerow (keyboard joke, get it?) it requires a different form of creativity; and it's not the creativity that drew me to the web.

So, in an effort to fill the balance out the creativity I sat down and learned Phaser and made a small game.

The space bar is your only button. It toggles between two modes:

- Shieled; where you take no damage
- Shooting; where you shoot, but take damage.

One hit and your dead. Have fun!
